We (Mindaugas Bražėnas, Gábor Horváth, Mikós Telek) have developed three parallel algorithms for fitting MAPs of ER-CHMM structure class. The procedures are implemented to be executed on GPU card using CUDA library. More details will be available in a paper 'Parallel algorithms for fitting Markov Arrival Processes'.
